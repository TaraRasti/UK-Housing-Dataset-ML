# UK-Housing-Dataset-ML
🏡 UK Housing Dataset 2024 — Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning

This notebook presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using real UK house price data to predict property prices based on various features such as location, property type, tenure, and transaction date.

📌 Key Features of This Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Identify missing values and outliers
Plot distributions, time trends, and correlations
Explore categorical variables with boxplots
Data Preprocessing:
One-hot encoding of categorical variables
Log-transformation of skewed target (price)
Missing value handling and feature scaling
Modeling:
Train a deep neural network (TensorFlow/Keras) for regression
Evaluate performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics
Address challenges like exploding loss and unstable predictions
Post-processing:
Reverse log-transformed predictions to original price scale
Visualize predicted vs actual prices
Handle prediction NaNs and outlier issues
